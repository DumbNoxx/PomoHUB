# PomoHub

*Focus. Work. Achieve. The timer that gets you in the zone.*

## About The Project

PomoHub is a modern and stylish Pomodoro timer designed for students, developers, and professionals who want to maximize their productivity. Inspired by the clean aesthetics of popular entertainment sites, PomoHub provides a familiar, yet powerful interface to help you stay focused and manage your work sessions effectively.

Our philosophy is simple: productivity tools should be as engaging and intuitive as the platforms you use for leisure. PomoHub brings that level of user experience to your study and work routines.
